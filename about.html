<h1>2014-2015</h1>
<p>The Orchestra performed on six occasions in 2014 and 2015, and this included a children’s concert at Riverway featuring music from Harry Potter and Peter and the Wolf. Masterworks conducted by Mark Sheills and featuring the 2013 Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition winner was performed in September with a follow up performance in the Burdekin. Last Night of the Proms was performed in November and conducted by Richard McIntyre and Sounds of Romance conducted by Raymond Yong. The Orchestra was also invited to open the Townsville Arts Awards with a cameo performance of the music from Frozen much to the audiences’ pleasure, particularly with the AV accompaniment.</p>

<h1>2013</h1>
<p>In 2013, the Orchestra staged three successful concerts with a total audience of 1200 patrons. In August the BRO had the well named “Contrasts” concert with conductor Raymond Yong and a program varying from Beethoven to Sculthorpe and featuring Elgar’s Cello Concerto with Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition winner Yoshika Masuda. Tarhis concert was also presented at the Burdekin Theatre, our first performance at another centre for many years. The concert was also notable for our collaboration with Umbrella Studio and ABC Open which resulted in a photo artists group forming to produce a video of images to accompany Schulthorpe’s Mangrove. The BRO also provided an ensemble to play at Anzac Park in September as part of the Bandstand Centenary event and then in October the Orchestra presented Hats off to Gilbert and Sullivan. This was a quite demanding production devised and conducted by Richard McIntyre and involved 80 singers from North Queensland Opera and Music Theatre and Townsville Choral Society. 2013 saw the Orchestra maintain their membership numbers and their financial position remained strong, covering approximately 60% of their expenditure from box office income (which is considered to be very good by not-for-profit arts organisation standards) and the remainder is covered by grants, sponsorship and philanthropy. Sponsors have also continued supporting the BRO. 2013 also saw the Orchestra’s first encouragement awards, with two young orchestra members – Craig Land and Lexie Gorton – each receiving well-deserved $500 awards in recognition of their enthusiastic participation in the orchestra and their musical development. </p>

<h1>2012</h1>
<p>2012 saw further increase in the BRO’s Audience. Three concerts were held during this year, one at Riverway Arts Centre and two at the Civic Theatre. All three concerts combined had a total of 1,434 patrons. There was also an increase in the number of players, which resulted in the Orchestra having 65 or more musicians on stage at each concert. Concerts in 2012 featured BRO’s artistic director Richard McIntyre (Conductor), the 2011 Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition winner as violin soloist- Edwina George, Sebastien Lipman, Conductor Mario Dobernig and Raymond Yong (pianist). 2012 was also particularly pleasing to welcome ten members of 1RAR band who joined us as musical partners in this performance.</p>

<div class="content">
<h1>2011</h1>
<p>2011 saw the Orchestra include other arts groups to great advantage – three choirs, 1RAR Band and Townsville Cinema Group were all involved with the Orchestra; and held three concerts that attracted a total of 1,457 patrons, new audience and new orchestra members. Concerts in this year featured Conductor David Lawrence and soloists from Brisbane and Mackay and the Spirit of the Voice Choir. Sponsorship support in 2011 was excellent and combined with good box office numbers has enabled the Orchestra to further build up its cash reserves which two years earlier were dangerously low.</p>

<h1>2010</h1>
<p>The series of great concerts and performances followed in 2010, featuring Ji Won Kim and Professor John Hopkins. In July 2010, the BRO celebrated its 10th anniversary with a concert conducted by Richard McIntyre, who also conducted the first Barrier Reef Orchestra ten years ago. More concerts followed, featuring the 2009 Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition winner Rebecca Chan.</p>

<div class="content">
<h1>2008-2009</h1>
<p>In 2008, the Orchestra received an award from the Townsville City Council as the "Best Musical Event 2007". Following the award, was a series of concerts and other performances that featured inspiring artists, like the UK conductor Mark Eager, the Innisfail-born, London-based concert pianist Piers Lane, Conductor Richard McIntyre, and the rising Oboist Megan Billing, among several others. The following year (2009), however, was the most challenging for the reasons ranging from failed concerts/performances to high tropical temperatures.</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<h1>2007</h1>
<p>In 2007, the Orchestra was invited in Cairns by the Piers Lane, the new Director of the AFCM, to perform at the Australian Festival of Chamber Music for the first time, accompanying Peter Coleman-Wright, an Australian Opera Baritone. In the same year, the Governor of Queensland became the patron of the Orchestra, together with the Orchestra’s founding patron, Professor John Hopkins. The Governor’s entry inspired further development of the orchestra during the year, that culminated in a sell-out concert featuring James Morrison, conductor Sean O"Boyle, jazz vocalist Emma Pask and a collaboration with Townsville Brass and the rhythm section from the amazing 1 RAR Band. The event of the year! </p>

<h1>2006</h1>
<p>The Barrier Reef Orchestra was born in 2000 in Canberra and became a North Queensland orchestra in March 2006. During the past few years, the Orchestra has performed with the comedy-duo Scared Weird Little Guys in Score, Townsville City Council’s Last Night of the Proms and A Christmas Carol. In 2003 the Council’s centenary year the Orchestra took part in Encore, as well as playing a major role in the Townsville Civic Theatre’s 25th Anniversary productions of Noye’s Fludde and Carmina Burana. Typically under the auspices of North Queensland Ensembles Inc., the Orchestra performs three times generally with a guest conductor and occasionally with other performing groups. Smaller ensembles, all utilising players from the Orchestra, regularly give concerts — Orpheus Strings, Pandanus Winds, Kingfisher Trio, Centenary Concert Band and the Barrier Reef Chamber Orchestra. In 2004, the Orchestra presented its first subscription series of three concerts receiving sponsorship from Queensland Nickel – Yabulu.</p>
